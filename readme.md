My original "Bomb defuse bot" for the game "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes" was written in C++ in 2017, because nobody wanted to play that game with me.
This is the new and improved version that I created ~Early 2020 to introduce myself to C#/C Sharp.
It isn't anything fancy, and it pretty much boils down to a bunch of if statements, but I haven't had the time since to work on a large project again.
